# v 0.1.4  #
############
Release Date: 30-Nov-2010

*) All the R functions were splited up into individual files.

Added Functions:
*) 'plot2parOF'   : for two user-defined parameters, it plots the values of the objective funtion in a two dimensional box, where the boundaries of each parameter are used as axis.
*) 'plotNparOF'   : for 'n' user-defined parameters, it produces 'plot2parOF' plots, with the values of the objective function for all the posible pairs of parameters 
*) 'plotNparLines': it plots the value of each parameter and the objective function against the iteration number.

Modified functions:
*) obs2swatcup : -) New arguments: 'version', 'var.id' needed for compatibility with SWAT-CUP version 3
*) qbeh2ecdfs  : -) New argument: 'leg.cex'


############
# v 0.1.3  #
############
Release Date: 08-Jul-2010

Added Functions:
*) 'plotparam'    : It makes dotty plots of different parameter values vs the corresponding objective function value (usually for plotting the efficiencies of different parameter sets).
*) 'read.goalsf2' : It reads the files 'modelpara.out' and 'modelpara.beh' created by the GLUE algorithm of SWAT-CUP', and the 'goal.sf2' file created by the SUFI-2 algorithm of SWAT-CUP.
*) 'read.95ppusf2': It reads the SWAT-CUP file '95ppu.sf2' , which contains the 95% of predictive uncertainty corresponding to the behavioural parameter sets, with optional plot.
*) 'read.qout '   : It reads the SWAT-CUP file (by default 'q1.out')  with the simulated streamflows for all the parameter sets.
*) 'qbeh2ecdfs'   : It computes ECDFs for user-defined quantiles of the streamflows simulated with behavioural parameter sets.
*) 'wquantile'    : It computes weighted quantiles of each column of a matrix/data.frame

Modified functions:
*) read.out.rch: -) Valid values for the argument 'tstep' were changed from c('Daily', 'Monthly', 'Annual') to c('daily', 'monthly', 'annual').
                 -) The argument 'drty' was replaced by 'file', because it is more intuitive for R users.
